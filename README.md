Title creator using html page, css and screen capture.
<div><p><strong>Notes:</strong> The company brand standards require site headers to be .jpg or .png files using a designated font with four title styles available.</p>
<p>Titles were created using Adobe products (PhotoShop or Fireworks) with very specific kerning and leading applied based on the title style.</p>
<p>With the advent of Adobe moving products to the cloud the company ceased providing licenses and installation of Adobe products.</p>
<p>I created this html page for our developers to create their site titles with the absence of image editing products.</p>
<p>The CSS is built specifically to provide the correct kerning and leading for each title style.</p>
<p>Font style, logo and additional items have been altered per NDA.</p></div>
